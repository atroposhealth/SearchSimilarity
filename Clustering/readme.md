# Topic Modelling 

This directory contains code for topic modelling created during the preparation of abstract for OHDSI symposium. 

lda.py is the code for topic modelling and outputs topics with top features in each topic. 

viz-lda.ipynb is the code for jupyter notebook for visualization of LDA model after topic modeling 

We have not used the topic modelling results for the OHDSI symposium as the reviewers pointed that the topic modelling essentially does nothing with search similarity.
However, we believe that topic modelling can be utilized to identify the "missing" phenotypes and can be used as a starting point to identify missing phenotypes.
